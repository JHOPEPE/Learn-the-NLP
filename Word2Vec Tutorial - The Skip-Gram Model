中英文摘要

The skip-gram neural network model is actually surprisingly simple in its most basic form; 
I think it’s all of the little tweaks and enhancements that start to clutter the explanation.因为细小的改变和强化，才让解释变得困难。这一点也是skip-gram neural network的难解释点。

We’re going to train a simple neural network with a single hidden layer to perform a certain task, 
but then we’re not actually going to use that neural network for the task we trained it on! 
Instead, the goal is actually just to learn the weights of the hidden layer–we’ll see that these weights are actually the “word vectors” that we’re trying to learn.
这里很trick的一点就是，我们这里用到的neural network的目的，并不是得到一个output，而是希望得到hidden layer中的weights，这个实际上就是我们希望得到的“word vectors”。
【类似的例子】
Another place you may have seen this trick is in unsupervised feature learning, where you train an auto-encoder to compress an input vector in the hidden layer, 
and decompress it back to the original in the output layer. After training it, 
you strip off the output layer (the decompression step) and just use the hidden layer--it's a trick for learning good image features without having labeled training data.

【Fake task】
We’re going to train the neural network to do the following. Given a specific word in the middle of a sentence (the input word), 
look at the words nearby and pick one at random. 
The network is going to tell us the probability for every word in our vocabulary of being the “nearby word” that we chose.我们需要nn（neural network）
告诉我们在我们词汇库中的每一个词，成为我们选择的这个“词A”的“临近词B”的概率。
{near by：When I say "nearby", there is actually a "window size" parameter to the algorithm. 
A typical window size might be 5, meaning 5 words behind and 5 words ahead (10 in total).窗口size，前五个词，后五个词。}
Example：
For example, if you gave the trained network the input word “Soviet”, 
the output probabilities are going to be much higher for words like “Union” and “Russia” than for unrelated words like “watermelon” and “kangaroo”.
